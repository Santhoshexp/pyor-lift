This is a simple lift based problem

How it works 
Step 1) - Trigger the test.py file and it goes on an infinite loop
Step 2) - Triiger the users.py file and enter any number between 1 -4 only.
Step 3) - You can observe in the test.py terminal that both are exchanging states and the lift moves to the users floor.
Step 4) - Now if the user wants to go to another floor , run the users.py file again and it will move the user to that floor ands stays there untill new users preses any button.
